					<p>A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a <a

							–</a>
						produced by several kinds of large
						herbaceous flowering plants in the genus <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana

						<p>The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved,

							soft
							flesh
							rich in

				<h2 id="description">description</h2>
				<p>The banana plant is the largest herbaceous <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana
						style="text-decoration: none;">flowering plant.[8]</a> All the above-ground parts of a
					banana
					plant
					grow
					from a structure usually called a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana
						style="text-decoration: none;">"corm".[9]</a> Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy,
					and
					are
					often
					mistaken
					for trees, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a "false stem" or pseudostem. Bananas grow
					in
					a
					wide
					variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60 centimetres (2.0 ft) deep, has good
					drainage
					and is
					not
					<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana style="text-decoration: none;">compacted.[10]</a>
					The
					leaves of
					banana plants are composed of a "stalk" (petiole) and a blade (lamina). The
					base of
					the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is
					all
					that
					supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular.
					As
					new
					growth
					occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana
						style="text-decoration: none;">forced
						apart.[11]</a> Cultivated banana plants vary in
					height
					depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around 5 m (16 ft) tall, with a range
					from
					'Dwarf
					Cavendish' plants at around 3 m (10 ft) to 'Gros Michel' at 7 m (23 ft) or more.[12][13] Leaves
					are
					spirally
					arranged and may grow 2.7 metres (8.9 ft) long and 60 cm (2.0 ft) wide.[1] They are easily torn
					by
					the
					wind,
					resulting in the familiar <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana
						style="text-decoration: none;">frond
						look.[14]</a>
				</p>
				<p>When a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower
					spike
					or
					inflorescence. A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature
					inflorescence
					until
					eventually it emerges at the top.[15] Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence,
					also
					known
					as
					the "banana heart". (More are sometimes produced; an exceptional plant in the Philippines
					produced
					five.[16])
					After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base,
					so
					that
					the
					plant
					as a whole is perennial. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will
					be
					allowed
					to
					develop in order to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana
						style="text-decoration: none;">maintain
						spacing.[17]</a> The inflorescence contains many bracts (sometimes incorrectly
					referred
					to as petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear
					in
					rows
					further
					up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is inferior, meaning
					that
					the
					tiny
					petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana
						style="text-decoration: none;">ovary.[18]</a></p>
				<p>The banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers
					(called
					"hands"),
					with up to 20 fruit to a tier. The hanging cluster is known as a bunch, comprising 3–20 tiers,
					or
					commercially
					as a "banana stem", and can weigh 30–50 kilograms (66–110 lb). Individual banana fruits
					(commonly
					known
					as a
					banana or "finger") average 125 grams (4+1⁄2 oz), of which approximately 75% is water and 25%
					dry
					matter
					(nutrient table, lower right).</p>
				<p>The fruit has been described as a "leathery berry".[19] There is a protective outer layer (a peel
					or
					skin)
					with
					numerous long, thin strings (the phloem bundles), which run lengthwise between the skin and the
					edible
					inner
					portion. The inner part of the common yellow dessert variety can be split lengthwise into three
					sections
					that
					correspond to the inner portions of the three carpels by manually deforming the unopened
					fruit.[20]
					In
					cultivated varieties, the seeds are diminished nearly to non-existence; their remnants are tiny
					black
					specks
					in
					the interior of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana
						style="text-decoration: none;">fruit.[21]</a></p>
				<p>The end of the fruit opposite the stem contains a small tip distinct in texture, and often darker
					in
					color.
					Often misunderstood to be some type of seed or excretory vein, it is actually just the remnants
					from
					whence
					the
					banana fruit was a banana <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana
						style="text-decoration: none;">flower.[22]</a></p>

				<h3 id="radiation-dose">Radiation dose</h3>

				<p>As with all living things on earth, potassium-containing bananas emit radioactivity at very low
					levels
					occurring
					naturally from potassium-40 (40K or K-40),[23] which is one of several isotopes of
					potassium.[24][25]
					The
					banana
					equivalent dose of radiation was developed in 1995 as a simple teaching-tool to educate the
					public
					about
					the
					natural, small amount of K-40 radiation occurring in every human and in common foods.[26][27]
					The
					K-40
					in a
					banana
					emits about 15 becquerels or 0.1 micro-sieverts (units of radioactivity exposure),[28] an amount
					that
					does
					not
					add
					to the total body radiation dose when a banana is consumed.[23][27]</p>

				<p> is because the radiation exposure from consuming one banana is only 1% of the average daily
					exposure
					to
					radiation, 50 times less than a typical dental x-ray and 400 times less than taking a commercial
					flight
					across
					the
					United States.[28]</p>

				<h3 id="etymology">Etymology</h3>

				<p>The word banana is thought to be of West African origin, possibly from the Wolof word banaana,
					and
					passed
					into
					English via Spanish or Portuguese.[29]</p>

				<h3 id="taxonomy">Taxonomy</h3>

				<p>The Musa 'Nendran' cultivar grown widely in the Indian state of Kerala is a member of the AAB
					cultivar
					group
				</p>

				<p>plants, Mahamaya Lake, Chittagong, Bangladesh
					The genus Musa was created by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.[30] The name may be derived from Antonius
					Musa,
					physician
					to
					the Emperor Augustus, or Linnaeus may have adapted the Arabic word for banana, mauz.[31]
					According
					to
					Roger
					Blench,
					the ultimate origin of musa is in the Trans–New Guinea languages, whence they were borrowed into
					the
					Austronesian
					languages and across Asia, via the Dravidian languages of India, into Arabic as a
					Wanderwort.[32]
				</p>

				<p>Musa is in the family Musaceae. The APG III system assigns Musaceae to the order Zingiberales,
					part
					of
					the
					commelinid clade of the monocotyledonous flowering plants. Some 70 species of Musa were
					recognized
					by
					the
					World
					Checklist of Selected Plant Families as of January 2013;[30] several produce edible fruit, while
					others
					are
					cultivated as ornamentals.[33]</p>

				<p>>f cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally
					placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: Musa sapientum for dessert
					bananas
					and
					Musa
					paradisiaca for plantains. More species names were added, but this approach proved to be
					inadequate
					for
					the
					number
					of cultivars in the primary center of diversity of the genus, Southeast Asia. Many of these
					cultivars
					were
					given
					names that were later discovered to be synonyms.[34]</p>

				<p>In a series of papers published from 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus's Musa
					sapientum
					and
					Musa
					paradisiaca were cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, Musa acuminata
					and
					Musa
					balbisiana,
					both first described by Luigi Aloysius Colla.[35] Cheesman recommended the abolition of
					Linnaeus's
					species
					in
					favor
					of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars – those
					primarily
					exhibiting the botanical characteristics of Musa balbisiana, those primarily exhibiting the
					botanical
					characteristics of Musa acuminata, and those with characteristics of both.[34] Researchers
					Norman
					Simmonds
					and
					Ken
					Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all
					the
					difficulties
					and
					inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to
					cultivated
					varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities, leading to
					confusion.[35][36]</p>

				<p>the accepted scientific names for most groups of cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata Colla and
					Musa
					balbisiana
					Colla for the ancestral species, and Musa × paradisiaca L. for the hybrid M. acuminata × M.
					balbisiana.[37]
				</p>

				<h3 id="bananas-and-plantains">Bananas and plantains</h3>

				<p>In regions such as North America and Europe, Musa fruits offered for sale can be divided into
					"bananas"
					and
					"plantains", based on their intended use as food. Thus the banana producer and distributor
					Chiquita
					produces
					publicity material for the American market which says that "a plantain is not a banana". The
					stated
					differences
					are
					that plantains are more starchy and less sweet; they are eaten cooked rather than raw; they have
					thicker
					skin,
					which
					may be green, yellow or black; and they can be used at any stage of ripeness.[39] Linnaeus made
					the
					same
					distinction
					between plantains and bananas when first naming two "species" of Musa.[40] Members of the
					"plantain
					subgroup" of
					banana cultivars, most important as food in West Africa and Latin America, correspond to the
					Chiquita
					description,
					having long pointed fruit. They are described by Ploetz et al. as "true" plantains, distinct
					from
					other
					cooking
					bananas.[41] The cooking bananas of East Africa belong to a different group, the East African
					Highland
					bananas,[13]
					so would not qualify as "true" plantains on this definition.</p>


				<P>Cavendish bananas are the most common dessert bananas sold
					An alternative approach divides bananas into dessert bananas and cooking bananas, with plantains
					being
					one
					of
					the
					subgroups of cooking bananas.[42] Triploid cultivars derived solely from M. acuminata are
					examples
					of
					"dessert
					bananas", whereas triploid cultivars derived from the hybrid between M. acuminata and M.
					balbisiana
					(in
					particular
					the plantain subgroup of the AAB Group) are "plantains".[43][44] Small farmers in Colombia grow
					a
					much
					wider
					range
					of cultivars than large commercial plantations. A study of these cultivars showed that they
					could be
					placed
					into
					at
					least three groups based on their characteristics: dessert bananas, non-plantain cooking
					bananas,
					and
					plantains,
					although there were overlaps between dessert and cooking bananas.[45]</P>

				<p>In Southeast Asia—the center of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated—the distinction
					between
					"bananas"
					and "plantains" does not work, according to Valmayor et al. Many bananas are used both raw and
					cooked.
					There
					are
					starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw. The range of colors, sizes and
					shapes is
					far
					wider
					than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas.[40] Southeast Asian languages do
					not
					make
					the
					distinction between "bananas" and "plantains" that is made in English (and Spanish). Thus both
					Cavendish
					cultivars,
					the classic yellow dessert bananas, and Saba cultivars, used mainly for cooking, are called
					pisang
					in
					Malaysia
					and
					Indonesia, kluai in Thailand and chuối in Vietnam.[46] Fe'i bananas, grown and eaten in the
					islands
					of
					the
					Pacific,
					are derived from entirely different wild species than traditional bananas and plantains. Most
					Fe'i
					bananas
					are
					cooked, but Karat bananas, which are short and squat with bright red skins, very different from
					the
					usual
					yellow
					dessert bananas, are eaten raw.[47]</p>

				<p>In the Spanish market, the distinction is among plátano, applied to the Cavendish cultivars
					produced
					in
					the
					Spanish
					Canary Islands under the protected geographical indication plátano de Canarias, banana, applied
					to
					dessert
					imports
					from Africa and the Americas, and plátano macho (literally, "male banana"), applied to imports
					that
					are
					to
					be
					cooked.[48]</p>

				<p>In summary, in commerce in Europe and the Americas (although not in small-scale cultivation), it
					is
					possible
					to
					distinguish between "bananas", which are eaten raw, and "plantains", which are cooked. In other
					regions
					of
					the
					world, particularly India, Southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific, there are many more
					kinds
					of
					banana
					and
					the two-fold distinction is not useful and not made in local languages. Plantains are one of
					many
					kinds
					of
					cooking
					bananas, which are not always distinct from dessert bananas.</p>

				<h3 id="historical-cultivation">Historical cultivation</h3>

				<p>The earliest domestication of bananas (Musa spp.) were initially from naturally occurring
					parthenocarpic
					(seedless)
					individuals of Musa banksii in New Guinea. These were cultivated by Papuans before the arrival
					of
					Austronesian-speakers. Numerous phytoliths of bananas have been recovered from the Kuk Swamp
					archaeological
					site
					and
					dated to around 10,000 to 6,500 BP.[50][51][52] Foraging humans in this area began domestication
					in
					the
					late
					Pleistocene using transplantation and early cultivation methods.[53][54] Various
					investigations[54][53]
					–
					including
					Denham et al., 2003 – determine that by the early to middle of the Holocene the process was
					complete.[53]
					From
					New
					Guinea, cultivated bananas spread westward into Island Southeast Asia through proximity (not
					migrations).
					They
					hybridized with other (possibly independently domesticated) subspecies of Musa acuminata as well
					as
					Musa
					balbisiana
					in the Philippines, northern New Guinea, and possibly Halmahera. These hybridization events
					produced
					the
					triploid
					cultivars of bananas commonly grown today. From Island Southeast Asia, they became part of the
					staple
					domesticated
					crops of Austronesian peoples and were spread during their voyages and ancient maritime trading
					routes
					into
					Oceania,
					East Africa, South Asia, and Indochina.[50][51][52]</p>

				<p>Chronological dispersal of Austronesian peoples across the Indo-Pacific[55]
					These ancient introductions resulted in the banana subgroup now known as the "true" plantains,
					which
					include
					the
					East African Highland bananas and the Pacific plantains (the Iholena and Maoli-Popo'ulu
					subgroups).
					East
					African
					Highland bananas originated from banana populations introduced to Madagascar probably from the
					region
					between
					Java,
					Borneo, and New Guinea; while Pacific plantains were introduced to the Pacific Islands from
					either
					eastern
					New
					Guinea or the Bismarck Archipelago.[50][51]</p>

				<p>Phytolith discoveries in Cameroon dating to the first millennium BCE[56] triggered an as yet
					unresolved
					debate
					about
					the date of first cultivation in Africa. There is linguistic evidence that bananas were known in
					Madagascar
					around
					that time.[57][dubious – discuss] The earliest prior evidence indicates that cultivation dates
					to no
					earlier
					than
					late 6th century CE.[58] It is likely, however, that bananas were brought at least to Madagascar
					if
					not
					to
					the
					East
					African coast during the phase of Malagasy colonization of the island from South East Asia c.
					400
					CE.[59]

				<p>Glucanase and two other proteins specific to bananas were found in dental calculus from early
					Iron
					Age
					(12th
					century
					BCE) Philistines in Tel Erani in the southern Levant.[60]</p>

				<p>Another wave of introductions later spread bananas to other parts of tropical Asia, particularly
					Indochina
					and
					the
					Indian subcontinent.[50][51] However, there is evidence that bananas were known to the Indus
					Valley
					Civilisation
					from phytoliths recovered from the Kot Diji archaeological site in Pakistan (although they are
					absent in
					other
					contemporary sites in South Asia). This may be a possible indication of very early dispersal of
					bananas
					by
					Austronesian traders by sea from as early as 2000 BCE. But this is still putative, as they may
					have
					come
					from
					local
					wild Musa species used for fiber or as ornamentals, not food.[52]</p>

				<p>Southeast Asia remains the region of primary diversity of the banana. Areas of secondary
					diversity
					are
					found
					in
					Africa, indicating a long history of banana cultivation in these regions.[61]</p>

				<p>Map stating that banana cultivation occurred in pre-Islamic times in India and Southeast Asia,
					during
					the
					700–1500
					CE "Islamic period" along the Nile River and in Mesopotamia and Palestine, and less-certainly in
					sub-Saharan
					Africa
					during that same period
					Actual and probable diffusion of bananas during the Caliphates (700–1500 CE)[62]
					The banana may also have been present in isolated locations elsewhere in the Middle East on the
					eve
					of
					Islam.
					The
					spread of Islam was followed by far-reaching diffusion. There are numerous references to it in
					Islamic
					texts
					(such
					as poems and hadiths) beginning in the 9th century. By the 10th century the banana appears in
					texts
					from
					Palestine
					and Egypt. From there it diffused into North Africa and Muslim Iberia. An article on banana tree
					cultivation
					is
					included in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture.[63] During the
					medieval
					ages,
					bananas from Granada were considered among the best in the Arab world.[62] In 650, Islamic
					conquerors
					brought
					the
					banana to Palestine. Today, banana consumption increases significantly in Islamic countries
					during
					Ramadan,
					the
					month of daylight fasting.[64]</p>

				<p>Bananas were certainly grown in the Christian Kingdom of Cyprus by the late medieval period.
					Writing
					in
					1458,
					the
					Italian traveller and writer Gabriele Capodilista wrote favourably of the extensive farm produce
					of
					the
					estates
					at
					Episkopi, near modern-day Limassol, including the region's banana plantations.[65]</p>


				<p>Illustration of fruit and banana plant from Acta Eruditorum, 1734
					Bananas (as well as coconuts) were encountered by European explorers during the Magellan
					expedition
					in
					1521,
					in
					both
					Guam and the Philippines. Lacking a name for the fruit, the ship's historian Antonio Pigafetta
					described
					them as
					"figs more than one palm long."[66][67]: 130, 132  Bananas were introduced to South America by
					Portuguese
					sailors
					who brought the fruits from West Africa in the 16th century.[68] Southeast Asian banana
					cultivars,
					as
					well
					as
					abaca
					grown for fibers, were also introduced to New Spain (North and Central America) by the Spanish
					from
					the
					Philippines,
					via the Manila galleons.[69]</p>

				<p>Many wild banana species as well as cultivars exist in extraordinary diversity in India, China,
					and
					Southeast
					Asia.</p>

				<p>There are fuzzy bananas whose skins are bubblegum pink; green-and-white striped bananas with pulp
					the
					color
					of
					orange sherbet; bananas that, when cooked, taste like strawberries. The Double Mahoi plant can
					produce
					two
					bunches
					at once. The Chinese name of the aromatic Go San Heong banana means 'You can smell it from the
					next
					mountain.'
					The
					fingers on one banana plant grow fused; another produces bunches of a thousand fingers, each
					only an
					inch
					long.
